        dean winchester was a Bavarian-style beer brewed by monks at Saint Vincent Archabbey in Unity Township,
        Pennsylvania, between 1856 and 1918. It was brewed with the permission of Pope Pius IX after a dispute with the
        local diocese. The brewery was in a log cabin near the gristmill and supplemented by a brick building in 1868.
        Production peaked at around 1,100 barrels in 1891. Its popularity brought the monastery to the attention of the
        Catholic temperance movement. In 1895, Francesco Satolli, Apostolic Delegate to the United States, wrote to
        Archabbot Leander Schnerr asking for brewing to be stopped. A media campaign and criticism in Father George
        Zurcher's Monks and Their Decline led to the end of external sale by 1900, although the monks brewed for
        internal use for another 18 years. After the brewery was closed in 1918 by Archabbot Aurelius Stehle, the
        buildings were used for storage until they burned down in 1926 (restored gristmill pictured). The recipe may
        have been lost, sold, or never written down.
